# The Super Power of TypeScript

Through which the quality and maintainability of the code can be further increased, and through this, productivity can also be increased a lot.

## What is TypeScript?

A programming language that is built on JavaScript.

But not only JavaScript, many more features have been added here — which makes it super powerful.

---

## How Does the Quality of the Code Increase?

When we write code, we have to write the data type of our properties in TypeScript,  
which cannot be done in JavaScript.

As a result, we can understand what type a variable is before running the code —  
it is easy to catch mistakes, errors do not occur at runtime.

---

## Easy to Refactor

Because of the use of types, we can easily refactor the code whenever necessary.

Because typing makes the code very organized and easy for anyone to understand.

## TypeScript in the Industry Standard

When working in a team, sometimes it is difficult to understand other people's code.

But if we use TypeScript, everyone can easily understand the structure of the code.

This makes it much easier to maintain.

## Why TypeScript is the Master Choice

TypeScript is a master script that is based on JavaScript.

Through it, we can write code like JavaScript, but more safely and powerfully.

As a result, our productivity, code quality, and maintainability all increase.
